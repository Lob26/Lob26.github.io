  bio = """Hey there!ðŸ‘‹\n\t
  I'm a passionate student who's all about codingâ€”both the behind-the-scenes magic and the flashy front-end stuff. While I lean towards the back-end, I've dabbled in a bit of everything. Throughout my time at school, I've been the go-to leader, rallying teams like a pro.\n\t
  Got a problem? I love cracking codes and finding creative fixes. Learning's my jam, so I'm always on the lookout for new skills to add to my toolkit.\n\t
  I'm on the hunt for a gig that's not just a job, but a chance to grow in every direction. Oh, and when things get wild, I'm your guy for quick, savvy decisions. Let's make cool stuff together! ðŸš€"""
